                        We realised that there was a need for a protocol that intrinsically balanced sell 
                        pressure in a high volume uniswap game, 
                        while simultaneously rewarding hodlers. We leveraged this to create Aura.

                            and therefore, the entire code is automated.

                                At the end of 30 minutes, this eth is used to buyback the token. 
                                The tokens bought back are burnt forever.

                            Every 30 minutes, the buyback transaction is clubbed with the first transaction
                            at the end of the 30 minute period on uniswap. 
                            To reward the person that initiated this transaction, 
                            that particular buyer gets a 5% share of tokens in addition to his transaction.

                        <p>
                            There is no way to manually trigger the buyback. 
                            It is automatically clubbed with the first transaction
                             that occurs on uniswap at the end of every 30 minute cycle.
